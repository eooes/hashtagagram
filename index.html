	//Comments
	//You can filter by users or by like or both
	//I have also introduced a propery max_next_urls. This will load the pagination NextUrl, data. So if we have less photos than we need we will load the pagination next url if available. I have set it to 5 to limit requests to the server.
	// you can rename the max_next_urls to any other word you like in the plugin.
	
	//New wrapper_elements variable has been added, if you want to have unordered list(ul), add 'ul' in the array,
	//If you want to have link, add 'a' in the array
	//If you want only the images, then leave it empty like this []

Hashtagram Client mode DOC

To get the token, Below are the steps :

1. First you need to add another node with client name, client id, secret and redirect url in the clients.xml file that is on the server.

2. Then, you go to the link below
http://shopigram.tricky3.co.uk/generate-token.php?client=rickydazla, add the appropriate client name.

If client is found, you will be redirected to the Instagram login form, after successfully login, you will be redirected to the redirection url that has been stated in instagram. 
The authorization token will be found in the url.

3. You copy the authorization token and go to this page http://shopigram.tricky3.co.uk/savetoken.php , enter the client name and token and hit the Submit button. Token saved.

Now you can show the client liked media. I will recommend to set enable_cache:true.(cache_duration:1 -> is for 1 day)


Other things : 

1. client_mode:true, -> if set to false( plugin will behave like previously, get photos based on tag_name(then filter by likes and users)

2. client_name:'rickydazla',-> If client_mode is true, this one is needed to get the token from your server.

3. client_tags:['tattoo'] -> put tags here, this can be left empty[]. If you are filtering by tags, I will recommend you to set the enable_cache variable to true, because this filtering takes up some time.
